===MicroDriver PCA9685===
Design Specificiation

[ABOUT]
PCA9685 Driver for the MicroBit in the form of a library/makecode package.

[DESIGN]
Commication with the PCA9685 is done via i2c, All PCA9685 respond to thef
i2c address 0xE0, hence unless given otherwise, that address would be the 
default address used for communication with the PCA9685. 

The PCA9685 uses a control register to address the rest of its many registers
when writing to the PCA9685, the first byte  written to the PCA9685 would go
into the control register, which would select which register the rest of the
data goes to.

The PCA9685 would be designed as an OOP api as the user may wish to 
connect more than one PCA9685 - though a functional API may be used to simply
the use of the library

By default, the PCA9685 has 25 Mhz built in oscillator and a 200Hz PWM frequency
Exposed API
-----
PCA9685(i2c address) - create PCA9685 object for i2c address - defaults to global 
    LED all call address(see datasheet)
digital_write(pin, 1 or 0)- digital write to the given GVS pin 
digital_write( 1 or 0)- Same thing but for all GVS pins

analog_write(pin, %duty_cycle) - write % duty cycle to the a set of GVS pins on
    the PCA9685 - analog is a value mapping to pwm write as makecode SHIM does  
    not support floating point type mapping
analog_write_all(pin, %duty_cycle) -Same thing but for all GVS pins

pwm_write(pin, value) - PWM write value between 0 4095 to the pin on the PCA9685
pwm_write_all(value) - Same thing but for all GVS pins
==== Advanced ===== - API set as advanced in makecode
set_pwm_frequency(hertz) - set PWM modulation frequency
sleep() - activate low power sleep mode on the PCA9685. During this time PWM 
control is not available as the oscillator is turned off
wake() - activate low power sleep mode on the PCA9685
software_reset() - make the PCA9685 do a software reset

Internal Calls
----
configure_mode(setting, value) - configure the PCA9685 mode register's setting 
    for the given value
restore_mode() - restore previous mode, for operations that need to temporally
    change the mode register during its operation
register_write(reg, value) - write to the register on the PCA9685 given by 
    address the value
register_read(reg) - read value from the the register on the PCA9685 given.
add_alt_address() - FUTURE fucntionality - add an additional sub addrsss 

Servo Controller - used to control servos on the PCA9685 - subclass PCA9685
-----
move_servo(pin, angle_deg) - move the shaft of the servo on the given pin to
    the given angle in degrees
configure(pin, min, max) - configure the minmum and maximum pulses sent to
    the servo on the given pin
